## Services: Here to Help

We're committed to providing efficient and responsive services to the residents of The Horizon Residences.

## Maintenance Requests

To report a maintenance issue within the common areas of the building, please submit a Maintenance Request using the form below. This helps us track requests and ensure they are addressed in a timely manner. For urgent issues, please contact \[Emergency Contact Information, e.g., the Building Manager, a designated committee member] directly.
