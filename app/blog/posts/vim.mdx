## Services: Here to Help
We're committed to providing efficient and responsive services to the residents of The Horizon Residences.

## Maintenance Requests

To report a maintenance issue within the common areas of the building, please submit a Maintenance Request. This helps us track requests and ensure they are addressed in a timely manner.  You can access the Maintenance Request Form [Link to Form/Page].  For urgent issues, please contact [Emergency Contact Information, e.g., the Building Manager, a designated committee member] directly.

## Other Services

In addition to maintenance requests, we also assist with:

Providing access to building documents (by-laws, meeting minutes, etc.).

Answering questions about levies and payments.

Facilitating communication between residents.

Addressing concerns about building rules and regulations.

We are continually working to improve our services and welcome your feedback.
