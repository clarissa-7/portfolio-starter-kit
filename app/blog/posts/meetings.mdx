## Meetings: Staying Informed and Involved

The Strata Committee typically meets the second Tuesday of each month.  Meeting dates and times are posted on the building notice board or the website calendar, and all residents are welcome to attend.  The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is held annually and is a key opportunity for all owners to participate in the management of The Horizon Residences.

Meeting agendas typically include:

Review of recent maintenance and repair work.

Financial updates, including levy payments and expenses.

Discussions of upcoming projects or renovations.

Matters relating to building by-laws and compliance.

Resident concerns and feedback.

Correspondence received.

Meeting minutes are recorded and made available to all residents on the website or upon request to the Secretary. We believe in open communication and encourage residents to stay informed and involved in the decisions that affect our community.
