## Strata Building Rules for Residents
### General Conduct
Residents must behave in a way that does not cause nuisance or disturbance to others (e.g. no loud music after 10:00 PM).
All residents are responsible for the behaviour of their guests while on the property.
Smoking is prohibited in common areas (e.g. hallways, lifts, stairwells, balconies if smoke drifts).

### Cleanliness and Hygiene
Residents must keep balconies, patios, and windows clean and free of clutter.
No items may be stored in hallways, stairwells, or other common areas (e.g. shoes, bikes, prams).
Garbage must be securely bagged and placed inside bins, not left beside them.
Recycling rules must be followed, and bulky waste collections booked where applicable.

### Maintenance and Alterations
No structural alterations (e.g. knocking down walls, replacing floors) may be made without prior written approval from the Owners Corporation.
Any damage to common property caused by a resident or guest must be repaired at the residentâ€™s expense.

### Pets
Pets are only allowed with written approval from the Owners Corporation.
Approved pets must be kept under control and must not disturb other residents (e.g. barking dogs).
Pet waste must be cleaned up immediately, including in common areas.

### Parking
Vehicles must only be parked in designated spots; visitor spots are for visitors only.
No parking in fire zones, driveways, or common property without written permission.
Car repairs and washing are not permitted in car parks unless approved.

### Deliveries and Moving
Moving in or out must be scheduled in advance with the strata manager or building manager.
Protective pads must be used in lifts during moves, if provided.
Common areas must be kept clear and undamaged during move-ins/move-outs.

### Noise and Disturbance
Quiet hours are from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM. No loud parties, shouting, or disruptive noises.
Musical instruments, TVs, and other audio equipment should be used at reasonable volume.

### Use of Common Property
No private items (bikes, BBQs, plants, signage, furniture) may be left or installed in common areas without approval.
Residents may not modify gardens or landscaping.
BBQs, rooftop areas, and recreational spaces must be booked (if applicable) and left clean after use.

### Environmental Responsibility
Residents must switch off lights, appliances, and taps when not in use.
Excessive water or energy use may lead to by-law enforcement.
Air conditioning systems must not leak onto balconies or common property.

### Prohibited Activities
No illegal activity may occur on the property.
Use of units for short-term rental (e.g. Airbnb) is not permitted unless allowed by by-laws.
No signage, business advertising, or political flags may be displayed from windows or balconies.

## Breach of Rules
Breaches of these by-laws may result in:
A notice to comply issued by the Owners Corporation.
A fine issued by NSW Fair Trading (currently up to $1,100).
Escalation to NCAT for continued or serious breaches.
